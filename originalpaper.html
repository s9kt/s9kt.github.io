        <p>
          &emsp; The emergence of social media since the last two decades can only be described as a roller coaster of
          legal
          battles, political scandals, and constantly changing standards. Facebook, now named Meta, since its founding
          been involved in a variety of controversies and legal disputes over its privacy practices, most famously the
          Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. The photo based platform SnapChat has faced lawsuits over the degree of
          drug dealing that occurs over the platform due to its “disappearing messages” feature, which automatically
          clears chat history after 24 hours. The twists and turns of privacy concerns, extreme speech, and fake news
          have made consumers and lawmakers nervous for the future of social media. The instant messaging app Discord
          banned more than a million accounts in the first half of 2022 alone, mostly for child safety violations as
          well as exploitative content. With the track quickly running out, experts, lawmakers, and journalists all have
          their own solutions. Some want the government to regulate companies, some want companies to regulate
          themselves, and while both have merits, they also have shortcomings. However, why have one or the other? Why
          just these these two solutions? Choosing a little of many solutions is the most effective solution to the
          social media dilemma. <br>
          &emsp;Currently, those in favor of government regulation see the first step as the complete nullification of
          Section
          230, which is a law that allows internet companies to relieve themselves of liability for the content their
          users post on their platforms. While it has been effective in the early internet era to spur the creation of
          these networks, it lead to unforeseen consequences with the proliferation of extreme/false content,
          inconsistent, sometimes ineffective moderation of platforms. Section 230’s status is heavily contested between
          lawmakers, with concerns about upholding the right to free speech and government censorship being the primary
          opposing view. <br>
          &emsp;Anika Collier Navaroli, a senior fellow at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism, and Ellen K. Pao, the
          former
          CEO of forum platform Reddit, write in the LA Times a recommendation for lawmakers to consider the creation of
          a regulatory agency. This agency would be responsible for overseeing social media companies and ensuring they
          are transparent and consistent in their practices. The agency would “...have access to relevant company
          information and documents and the authority to hold noncompliant companies accountable”. The authors believe
          that this would be well within the reach of the government given the relatively recent creation of
          Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in 2018. <br>
          Unfortunately, I believe there are some limitations with this approach. I concede that government involvement
          is necessary to deal with social media, but the creation of a new government agency requires the approval of
          Congress and a consensus about the scope and duties of such an agency. Given the radical political divide our
          country faces today, it may be difficult to achieve this at all. Even if the topic were to be approached my
          lawmakers, it could spark larger concerns about government surveillance and privacy rights with social media.
          NYU’s Stern Center for Business & Human Rights published a report in 2022 that argues for the enhancement of
          the FTC. The report claims that due to the inadequacy of industry self regulation and the unlikeliness of
          radical change within silicon valley, lawmakers should seek to empower the FTC to create and enforce standards
          for social media companies. The FTC would not set guidelines detailing what is allowed speech or not, but
          rather force companies to remain transparent about their moderation practices and their standards for
          communication. If a company is found to be taking unlawful or unfair action against a certain type of speech
          that is not outlined in their policies, the FTC would have the right to interject and prosecute the company.
          Unfortunately, there is a hurdle in this solution as well. Amending Section 230 to allow the FTC to prosecute
          companies that violate the their standards would require bipartisan support and a concrete understanding of
          exactly how much authority to give the FTC. Another issue with just empowering the FTC is that responding to
          violations and then prosecuting them can take a long time. <br>
          &emsp;Pao and Navaroli believe that “The lack of social media industry standards and metrics to track safety
          and
          harm has driven us to a race to the bottom”. While it is true there is a lack of industry regulation, is it
          necessary for this regulation to only come from the government? In the solution I reference, there is a decent
          chance that the FTC would have their hands in constitutional chains, with the lock being the first amendment.
          In the movie and video game industry, there exists self regulation in the form of safety ratings. In her Texas
          A&M Law Review article, Nina Brown goes over the different proposals of regulation; self regulation,
          government regulation, and industry regulation. Brown finds that industry regulation is the most balanced form
          of regulation, since self regulation is too opaque and too inconsistent, government regulation is difficult to
          trust and violates the first amendment. She finds that a “self-regulatory council” (SRC), which “...develop
          standards and protocols that promote order and efficiency across the industry”, can be an organizational model
          for an industry to either regulate independently or cooperatively with authorities. Brown provides multiple
          examples of SRCs in practice, such as the American Bar Association and the National Association of Realtors.
          The hypothetical SRC would be composed of volunteers from various members of the industry, with the goal of
          “...avoid[ing] government regulation and improv[ing] public perception.” The SRC would together set a clear
          definition of “hate speech”, and work to set a consistent standard of moderation. Richard Ashby Wilson and
          Molly K Land are well regarded professors at the University of Connecticut. They wrote an article about the
          importance of “context” in hate speech. Towards the end of the article they make several recommendations to
          social media companies about how to implement context into their moderation practices. For example, they
          “...encourage companies to move away from a one-size-fits-all model of hate speech regulation and to build a
          number of different models that are appropriate to the conditions on the ground in the countries concerned.”
          As well as creating “… sub-regional or country-specific lists of slurs and hateful expressions that are drawn
          up after consultation with local civil society organizations, sociolinguists, and other experts.” JASIST, a
          technology journal, published an article about the growing usage of “context labeling”. Through various user
          interfaces, social media companies have been able to inform users about the source of the media they see, as
          well as the validity of that media. Regarding the future of context labeling, the article recommends
          crowdsourcing the context labels, as opposed to using AI generated labels, and for social media companies to
          help their users improve their media literacy. These recommendations would be researched and developed by the
          hypothetical SRC, which would public its findings, and set a standard for social media companies to abide by.
          If this were to be a co-governance model with the FTC, the FTC could help ensure that the SRC is truly acting
          upon the recommendations of experts. <br>
          &emsp;The solution to the AI dilemma is complex, with the lack of a “one size fits all” solution. One day, we
          will
          be able to interact with others online knowing that we are having productive discussions to improve society,
          as opposed to the hateful spouts that occur over Twitter today. Maybe once social media companies are able to
          regulate their content standards, they will also be able to reinvent their algorithms, or their business
          models, and create a better “online town square” that the original creators of social media intended.

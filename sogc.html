          Professor Corbridge <br>
          Assignment 3 <br>
          &emsp; The infographic assignment has changed my understanding of rhetoric and composition by making me
          understand
          how different mediums can portray a different message through hands on experience rather than simply reading
          it from a textbook. More specifically, I have a better understanding of how to use visuals to convey
          information. I’ve considered my exigence the most when creating the infographic because now is a time when
          social media is the most controversial and when most people are willing to recognize that there is a problem
          that needs to be solved. I also heavily considered audience in my infographic by designing it after the iPhone
          UI, which most of my audience should be at least a little familiar with. This also affected how I re-imagined
          my paper. The original paper contained a lot of policy research, talking about the legal implications of
          creating a new agency or empowering a current one. Instead, this infographic aims to address the day to day
          concerns of a broad audience. The assumptions I am making is that they recognize the iPhone message UI and
          that they understand the role that social media plays in influencing our real world. I also assume that my
          audience is familiar with certain slang or shorthand methods of texting, I.e “abt” as a shorthand for “about”,
          or “ppl” as shorthand for “people”. I am also assuming that they are not members of big tech, who benefit from
          a lack of regulation in social media. While I do not address it directly, I assume that my audience may
          believe that their ideologies are being censored on the internet. In regards to infographics themselves, I
          assume that infographics can be a relevant medium. For example, Instagram posts can easily feature
          infographics. I assume that an infographic needs to be recognizable and stand out in a way. I am assuming that
          having a phone UI would be easily recognizable and draw eyes to. The way I write my text for the text on the
          iMessage log assumes that my audience likes to use slang and send many short messages at a time. For my topic,
          I assume that social media is currently a net negative on society and needs to be remedied. I also assume that
          a majority of my audience is familiar with social media, how it works, and who its major players are. <br>
          &emsp; While I originally intended for the audience to be lawmakers, obtaining feedback from you and my peers
          made me
          believe that my infographic is accessible to anyone. This change also highlighted the fact that my original
          essay could be more easily read by lawmakers or other experts, whereas the infographic is much more
          accessible. This audience change reflected the most in my iMessage chat log. Originally, I had written
          questions about the potential for the government policy to actually work. Now, I shifted my focus to the
          concerns of the daily person as well as clarifying the need for social media regulation at all. The visual
          design also changed from a few long messages to many small, short messages as I mentioned previously. Another
          revision I had made during the design process was how I integrated my works cited. I wasn’t sure I’d be able
          to properly fit a works cited, seeing my peers simply shove their sources into the bottom of the infographic
          didn’t feel right to do, so I decided to simply include it separately. After conferencing with you, I decided
          to change the iMessage chat log from an individual lazily named “Expert” to a group chat named “The Experts”,
          with the profile pictures showing authors of the papers I referenced in my original paper and the infographic.
          Using this format, I was able to put a credible name to an answer by putting the expert as the author of the
          text message. I employed an AI large language model called “Claude” by Anthropic a lot in the revision
          process. While my peer feedback was appreciated, it didn’t address my biggest concern: Too much text on the
          iMessage chat log. Using the AI, I was able to craft more concise messages that fit the tone of a text
          setting, which made the infographic even more fitting for the general public. <br>
          &emsp; I’ve also taken careful thought into making my web portfolio. Using a template repository I found
          online, I
          scripted a LinkedIn clone which presents my project in a recognizable format. While searching for a fitting
          repository I found myself slowly also learning small bits and pieces of the web design of social media pages.
          The big image covers in the middle with the red notification dots and the likes button. Not to mention all of
          the different TikTok styled short form video scrolling tabs. Of course I also noticed all of the
          advertisements, whether embedded directly into posts or as separate ad banners. I am assuming that much of my
          audience is too young to be familiar with LinkedIn. Despite this assumption, I found it to be the best
          template because it required filling less content on the page. Even though it’s less content, it still
          resembles the original LinkedIn website pretty closely, other than the fact that there is only a feed and
          nothing else. For the convenience of the viewer, I’ve put the infographics as scroll-able PDF files. I also
          stripped text heavy “posts” and have a “show more” button to travel to a separate page. To immerse the viewer,
          I’ve utilized the “Trending News” tab on the right side to show actual news articles that have recently
          appeared. The specific articles I chose mostly talk about social media related policy or impact. I include
          some light humor in the “copyright” statement to ease the viewer’s emotions about the issue of social media
          regulation. One of the ways that I would have improved upon this project, if I had time, would be to recreate
          the “My Network” page to serve as my works cited directly. I also could’ve worked the “ad” idea to demonstrate
          how social media networks might compromise your privacy.
